***About Skill Learning Project***
### Short brief about this project:
This project is for develop skill and career by training system. Student can enrolled any kinds of courses and get deep knowledge about these courses. Any one can browse this page, everything is opened for all without Checkout page.. 

### When user must have to log in:
--Basically everybody should need to login first because of their identity. But we allows to open for all without login. We considered them as tourist but We always focused and give more opportunity for registered users--
<sub>Login is mandatory when user wants to go checkout page. Its simple because checkout page is for enrolment in specific course. After enrollment, this user is consider as a student. We need to contact with students and give certificate after completing his course. That's why user need to login and provide his information </sub>

~~If user is new or not comfortable to login with google or github account, He have to registered first~~

~~404 page is designed for all unaccepted location from this website. We create a extra route for 404.~~

### FAQ Page
-It's the very helpful page for all as i think. Here 15 individual questions and answer is given-

### Use of technologies in this project:
__*Framework: Tailwind*__
Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesnâ€™t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.

For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site


_*Component Library: Daisy UI*_
It's a themeable UI components library. It is a plugin for Tailwind CSS. Faster development, Cleaner HTML, Customizable and themeable. Pure CSS. Works on all frameworks. I used many attractive features and component from *Daisy UI*


## Conclusion
_Finally, I can fulfil this project by 3 days working. I think it would be be attractive for all users. This project will be update if needed_
